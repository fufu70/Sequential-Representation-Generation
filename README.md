# Sequential-Representation-Generation

Attempts to take the cowards way out and brute force all possible equations from increasing order of 1 to 9. This is built off of Inder J. Taneja's [Crazy Sequential Representation: Numbers from 0 to 11111 ...](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.1479.pdf) paper that lists all possible solutions (excluding 10958) for each whole number from 0 to 11111 using a equation with the sequential contents 1 to 9.
