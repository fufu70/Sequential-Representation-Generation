# Sequential-Representation-Generation

Attempts to take the cowards way out and brute force all possible equations from increasing order of 1 to 9. This is built off of Inder J. Taneja's (Crazy Sequential Representation: Numbers from 0 to 11111 ...)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.1479.pdf] paper that lists all possible solutions (excluding 10958) for each whole number from 0 to 11111 using a equation with the sequential contents 1 to 9.

## How to use

We used node to run the project

```
$ npm install
$ node index.js
```

It will save all of the results in result.csv

## Requirements

This project uses (node)[https://nodejs.org/en/]. Once installed you should have npm, the package manager, with it.
